Low-resolution experimental techniques provide valuable structural information on biomolecule at near-native conditions, which are often combined with molecular simulations to determine and refine protein structural ensembles. In this study, we demonstrate how small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) information can be incorporated in Markov state model-based adaptive sampling strategy to enhance time efficiency of unbiased MD simulations and identify functionally relevant conformations of proteins and complexes. Our results show that using SAXS data combined with additional information, such as thermodynamics and distance restraints, we are able to distinguish otherwise degenerate structures due to the inherent ambiguity of SAXS pattern. We further demonstrate that adaptive sampling guided by SAXS and hybrid information can significantly reduce the computation time required to discover target structures. Overall, our findings demonstrate the potential of this hybrid approach in predicting near-native structures of proteins and complexes. Other low-resolution experimental information can be incorporated in a similar manner to collectively enhance unbiased sampling and improve the accuracy of structure prediction from simulation.","tags":null,"title":"SAXS-guided Enhanced Unbiased Sampling for Structure Determination of Proteins and Complexes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Saurabh Shukla+","Chuankai Zhao+","Diwakar Shukla (+ denotes co-first author)"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1543989600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543989600,"objectID":"894ce9060c9dac6626e37b5e2f692df5","permalink":"http://chuankaizhao.github.io/publication/2019-structure/","publishdate":"2018-12-05T00:00:00-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-structure/","section":"publication","summary":"Plant hormones are essential mediators of plant responses to environmental stresses. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a hormone that helps plants survive drought by mediating guard cell closure. Since the identification of PYR/PYL/RCAR ABA receptors, the mechanism underlying ABA signaling has been intensely investigated. However, dynamic and energetic aspects of ABA-mediated activation of receptors and their down-regulation by post-translational modifications remain elusive. Using molecular simulations, we establish complete ABA recognition pathways by two sub-type receptors (PYL5, PYL10) and a modified PYL5 receptor through tyrosine nitration. Energetic landscapes reveal that ABA binding is necessary but insufficient for full receptor activation, and ABA must surmount a large energy barrier to bind the receptors. The major barrier appears to be associated with substantial dewetting of both ABA and receptor during ABA binding. Finally, our results suggest that tyrosine nitration of ABA receptors alters the binding pocket, thereby preventing ABA perception and receptor activation.","tags":[],"title":"Dewetting Controls Plant Hormone Perception and Initiation of Drought Resistance Signaling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erfan Mohammadi","Chuankai Zhao","Yifei Meng","Ge Qu","Fengjiao Zhang","Xikang Zhao","Jianguo Mei","Jian-Min Zuo","Diwakar Shukla","Ying Diao"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1499960352,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1499960352,"objectID":"31e8b696769fc3b31f3ee5ab037dbb8b","permalink":"http://chuankaizhao.github.io/publication/2017-nature-communications/","publishdate":"2017-07-13T09:39:12-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-nature-communications/","section":"publication","summary":"Solution processable semiconducting polymers have been under intense investigations due to their diverse applications from printed electronics to biomedical devices.

The effects of the Cu UPD potential and time on the deposited Cu and the redox replaced Pt layer on the electrode were investigated. The amount of the deposited Cu and Pt was determined by the anodic stripping method. The electrocatalytic activity of the Pt decorated electrodes for ammonia oxidation was characterized by cyclic voltammetry. The results showed that the Cu UPD potential has a significant influence on the formed Cu layer and the subsequent Pt submonolayer. The Cu deposition behaviour changes from UPD process to overpotential deposition (OPD) process with the decrease of deposition potential. Besides, the amount of the deposited Cu increases as the Cu deposition potential decreases. Consequently, Pt layer with different coverage on the electrode can be effectively controlled by adjusting the Cu UPD potential. The Pt submonolayer electrodes prepared by the redox replacement of Cu UPD layer have a high mass activity for ammonia oxidation, and their mass activities are more than two times higher than that of the Pt decorated electrodes obtained by redox replacement of Cu OPD layer. Besides, the Pt submonolayer electrodes also have a higher specific activity possibly due to the modification in structural and electronic properties of the Pt submonolayer induced by the Au substrate.","tags":[],"title":"Fabrication of platinum submonolayer electrodes and their high electrocatalytic activities for ammonia oxidation","type":"publication"}]
