In recent years, solution processable semiconducting polymers have demonstrated potential uses in a diverse range of applications from organic electronics to medical devices, thanks to rapid materials innovation and six orders of magnitude improvement in charge carrier mobilities over the last thirty years. It is well-demonstrated that the charge transport properties of semiconducting polymers depend strongly on morphological parameters such as π–π stacking distance, degree of crystallinity and in-plane alignment of polymer backbones. However, controlling the molecular assembly of semiconducting polymers during solution coating methods compatible with high-throughput, large-area solution coating methods remains a key challenge. As a result, printed polymer thin films frequently exhibit non-ideal morphologies limiting their device performance and commercial viability. Crystallization of a molecular solid from solution often initiates at solid–liquid interfaces. Thus, rational design of templates has traditionally been an important approach for manufacturing a wide range of materials from inorganic electronics to pharmaceuticals. Inspired by biological processes, we designed a composite template to control the multiscale assembly of semiconducting polymers via surface-induced crystallization during meniscus-guided coating. Template surface chemistry can be manipulated to interact cooperatively with the assembling polymers and to optimize polymer-template interactions leading to a level of morphology control otherwise not possible using common substrates. Molecular dynamic simulations verified our design notion and the critical role of template surface structure in expediting the crystallization process. Morphological characterizations demonstrated that this method, along with uniaxial coating, induced long-range in-plane alignment and produced highly crystalline microstructures of conjugated polymers over large area (1cm2). Tunable degree of alignment in template-directed thin films provides an opportunity for investigating alignment-charge transport relationship.

Abscisic acid (ABA) is a key plant hormone that imparts drought resistance in plants. Crystal structures of receptors (PYLs) involved in ABA perception have shed light on the interactions ABA makes in the binding pocket of the receptor but these structures provide limited knowledge about the dynamic mechanism of ABA binding. Mechanistic understanding of ABA recognition by plants could provide new avenues for development of drought resistant agrochemicals. In this work, we have performed extensive atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using Markov state models (MSMs) based adaptive sampling protocols to characterize ABA binding pathway for two ABA receptors in A. Thaliana, AtPYL5 and AtPYL10 receptors belonging to different sub-classes of ABA receptors to identify the major bottlenecks in their binding pathways. Our results not only explain the binding mechanism of ABA molecule but also provide atomistic information about the intermediate states along the binding pathways.

Knowledge of ABA binding mechanism will help in improving drought resistance in plants by informing genetic manipulations and agrochemical discovery efforts.","tags":[],"title":"Machine Learning Guided Ligand-Protein Simulation Approach Elucidates the Binding Mechanism of Abscisic Acid","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Zahra Shamsi","Saurabh Shukla","Chuankai Zhao","Diwakar Shukla"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1479218400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1479218400,"objectID":"a8197a24893448a582259450321206b9","permalink":"http://chuankaizhao.github.io/talk/2016-aiche-markov-model/","publishdate":"2016-11-14T18:00:00-20:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2016-aiche-markov-model/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Markov State Models Provide Insights into Dynamic Modulation of Protein Function","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Balaji Selvam","Shriyaa Mittal","Chuankai Zhao","Diwakar Shukla"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1479177600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1479177600,"objectID":"6b5895ace0b153a00a65d6c94643bf5c","permalink":"http://chuankaizhao.github.io/talk/2016-aiche-design-probes/","publishdate":"2016-11-14T13:10:00-13:30","relpermalink":"/talk/2016-aiche-design-probes/","section":"talk","summary":"In this talk, we plan to answer a broad question about design of experiments and validation of protein conformational ensembles, what is the minimum experimental information required for describing the conformational dynamics of a protein? Markov state models of protein dynamics describe the transitions between the conformational states of proteins using a transition probability matrix built from the raw simulation data. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors/eigenfunctions of the transition matrix provide the timescales and the population shift between states due to a particular dynamic process respectively. Considering only the m-slowest processes, an ideal set of experimental observations would unequivocally describe these m-slowest processes using only m-experimental observables. Our machine learning protocol involves using the variational approach for building Markov state models that provides approximation of the first m eigenfunctions of the molecular dynamics propagator using all possible experimental probe positions on the protein and picks the optimal set of probe locations that best describe the m-slowest processes. In this work, we combine two central ideas from machine learning and chemical physics - hyperparameter selection via cross-validation and variational approaches for linear operator eigenproblems; to create a new method for predicting observables that optimally discriminate between alternative models for molecular kinetics constructed from MD simulations. This protocol could also be used with a broad range of experimental techniques or a combination of experimental techniques. We present results from application of this protocol to three systems of biological importance, conformational change in membrane peptide transporter PepTSO and β2-Adrenergic receptor, and folding of WW domain.","tags":[],"title":"Design of Optimal Experimental Probes for Protein Dynamics Using Machine Learning and Variational Approach to Modeling Conformational Kinetics","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Zhengyang Ni","Jie Liu","Yating Wu","Bin Liu","Chuankai Zhao","Yida Deng","Wenbin Hu","Cheng Zhong"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1442763109,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1442763109,"objectID":"bc458f4e7c3dc17b7f66e9f99aaab4d0","permalink":"http://chuankaizhao.github.io/publication/2015-electrochimica-acta/","publishdate":"2015-09-20T09:31:49-06:00","relpermalink":"/publication/2015-electrochimica-acta/","section":"publication","summary":"Pt submonolayer with different coverage on the Au electrode for ammonia oxidation was prepared by Cu underpotential deposition (UPD) followed by redox replacement of UPD Cu by Pt. The effects of the Cu UPD potential and time on the deposited Cu and the redox replaced Pt layer on the electrode were investigated. The amount of the deposited Cu and Pt was determined by the anodic stripping method. The electrocatalytic activity of the Pt decorated electrodes for ammonia oxidation was characterized by cyclic voltammetry. The results showed that the Cu UPD potential has a significant influence on the formed Cu layer and the subsequent Pt submonolayer. The Cu deposition behaviour changes from UPD process to overpotential deposition (OPD) process with the decrease of deposition potential. Besides, the amount of the deposited Cu increases as the Cu deposition potential decreases. Consequently, Pt layer with different coverage on the electrode can be effectively controlled by adjusting the Cu UPD potential. The Pt submonolayer electrodes prepared by the redox replacement of Cu UPD layer have a high mass activity for ammonia oxidation, and their mass activities are more than two times higher than that of the Pt decorated electrodes obtained by redox replacement of Cu OPD layer. Besides, the Pt submonolayer electrodes also have a higher specific activity possibly due to the modification in structural and electronic properties of the Pt submonolayer induced by the Au substrate.","tags":[],"title":"Fabrication of platinum submonolayer electrodes and their high electrocatalytic activities for ammonia oxidation","type":"publication"}]
